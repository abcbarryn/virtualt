<P> <H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="file">File Output</A></H2>
<p>The File Printer directs all LPT port output to a file or set of files based on the printer
configuration.  The printer can be configured to generate automatic filenames, prompt the user for
a filename, output to a specified directory, and print Session pages to different files.  Data
received during a Print Session will be written to the file as it is received.  Cancelling a
Print Session will cause the target output file to be deleted from the Host.  The File Printer
status can be monitored on the <a href=tools.html#file_print>File Printer</a> tab of the Peripherals 
Dialog box.

<p>The options on the the File Printer Properties dialog are:
<ul>
<li><b>File Output Directory</b> - Specifies the print directory for print files.
<li><b>Prompt for filename</b> - Indicated if VirtualT should prompt for a filename.
<li><b>Automatically generate filenames</b> - Enables automatic generation of filenames.
<li><b>Format</b> - Specifies the format to use for auto filename generation.
<li><b>Filter control codes</b> - Specifies if special control codes appear in output files.
</ul>

<P> <H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="host">Host Device</A></H2>
<p>The Host Device "printer" directs all LPT traffic to a generic Host Device.  The emulation
assumes there is an OS specific device driver capable of accepting printer data for further
processing.  This option allows the user to specify a host device that VirtualT will attempt
to open and subsequently write all LPT data.

<p> <H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="fx80">Emulated FX-80</A></H2>
<p>The FX-80 Emulation printer provides a 100% compatible Epson FX-80 Print emulation.  The 
emulation renders data to a 240 x 216 DPI memory "Page" to emulate the printer's native
print-pin resolution.  All ESCape sequence are supported including Font style, graphics, 
print head and paper control, and custom character definition.  The emulation includes a 
"built-in" ROM containing an exact image of all FX-80 characters with provisions to define and
select custom "replacement" character ROMs for added flexability.

<p>To provide flexability, the printer's "paper" is selectable from the Property Page.  This
allows the rendered pages to be displayed in a window, sent to a Postscript file, or sent
directly to a Linux or Windows printer.  Some of the output papers present the user with
options for controlling the output (ink density, filenames, etc.).  The printer can output to
only one paper type at any given time.

<p>Also provided are options for setting the printer's "DIP Switches" as per the original
FX-80 printer.

<p><img src="fx80_print_prop.jpg">

<p>The options in the Emulated FX-80 Property Dialog are:
<ul>
<li>Use External Character ROM - Overrides the internal character ROM.  Specify the file.
<li>Intialize Character RAM - Initializes the Character RAM from the specified file.
<li>Output Paper - Seletion of the destination for rendered pages.
<li>Dip Switch Settings - Various settings matching the original FX-80 Printer.
<li>Char Generator - Button to display the FX-80 Character Generator Dialog.
<li>Top of Form - Allows positioning of the "Paper" under the print head.
</ul>

<p><h3 ALIGN="LEFT">Character Generator</h3>
<p><img src="char_gen.jpg">

<p>The FX-80 Characer Generator Dialog allow creation and edting of external Character ROMs
for use with the FX-80 Emulation.  The dialog provides buttons for loading and saving ROM
data to specified filenames, selecting characters from the character map, copying and pasting
characters, and editing individual "dots" within the character.  Provisions for setting the
proportional "start" and "stop" column are currently not provided.  Instead, the emulation 
automatically calculates proportional spacing when rendering characters to the page.  The ROM 
character data can also be saved in ANSI "C" format or BASIC format.

<p>The character being edited can be selected by clicking on it in the character map or by 
using arrow keys to navigate the character map.  Edits to the character data are not updated
in the character map in real-time, but they are updated in the example font region to the
left of the edit-field in real-time.

<p>Editing in the edit-field follow FX-80 character print rules.  Specifically, only 8 of the
9 "pins" can be used for any single character.  Selecting either the top or bottom pin will
disable the other row.  Additionally, dots cannot be place directly beside one-another.  There
must be a full column separation between dots.  This is due to the printer's "pin firing" 
mechanism speed.
