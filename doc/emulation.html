<h2><a name="keyboard">Display</a></h2>
<p>VirtualT emulates the Model T LCD display at the hardware level, like it does all other devices.
Because of this, all software written for the Model T will also work on VirtualT, even if they make
direct access to the LCD hardware.
<p>The LCD hardware implementation varies depending on the emulation model.  For the T200, the LCD
uses a single controller with 8K display RAM.  On the other models, the LCD consists of 10
independant controllers, each responsibile for a specific region of the display.  With the exception
of the T200 control chip's character generator ROM, the VirtualT emulation exactly matches the
hardware at a register (I/O operation) level.
<p>Several features provided by the LCD emulation and can be accessed using the "Emulation->Display"
menu items.  These features are:
<UL>
<LI><b>Display Size:</b>  Allows magnification of the LCD (1x, 2x, 3x and 4x).  This is direct pixel copying
of each pixel on the LCD.
<LI><b>Solid Chars:</b>  Allows characters to be display with or without "spacing" between pixels.  On the real
Model T, the old LCD techonology was coarse enough to see the spacing.  This allows the user to 
choose between a "retro" look or a more readable look.
<LI><b>Framed:</b>  This feature allows the user to view the LCD with the familiar "black frame" as seen on the
original Model T, complete with function key labels, or as a simple window.
</UL>

<h2>Keyboard</h2>
<p>The Model T keyboard, while very easy to use, has a non-standard layout of special symbols and punctuation compared
with modern day keyboards.  The keyboard is a simple scan matrix of keys with 8 scan rows and 9 scan
columns.  Each model uses the same keyscan arragement, but each assigns the key mappings differently. 
Plus the Model T has a few extra keys that are not present on today's keyboards, such as CODE and GRPH.

<p>Because of these differences, VirtualT must perform keyboard translation based on the emulated Model.
Additionally, several keys of the standard 101-key keyboard are "mapped" to represent the extra keys
present on the Model T.  The mapping of these keys is as follows:
<p>
<pre>
   F9        - Label Key
   F10       - Print Key
   F11       - Paste Key
   F12       - Pause Key
   Left Alt  - GRAPH
   Right Alt - CODE
</pre>

<p>There are no user controls for controlling the operation of the keyboard emulation.

<h2><a name="speed">Speed</a></h2>
<p>Emulation speed can be controlled using the "Emulation->Speed" menu item.  Emulation speed is calculated
by analyzing the number of CPU cycles that have occurred over a given time interval.  A high-resolution timer
is used to measure time in milliseconds for accurate measurement.  Even using a high-resolution timer, the 
speed estimates calculated are still approximate.  For emulation speeds less than full speed, VirtualT slows
the emulation by performing an FLTK wait operation, effectively giving control back to the OS and putting the
application to "sleep".  There are four options for emulation speed accessible in the "Emulation->Speed" menu:
<p>
<pre>
   2.4 Mhz           - Forces emulation to match origial Model T speed
   Very CPU Friendly - Moderate emulation speed - consumes fewer Host CPU cycles 
   CPU Friendly      - Faster emulation speed - cosumes more Host CPU cycles
   Max Speed         - Provides the fastest emulation
</pre>

<h2><a name="optrom">Option ROMs</a></h2>
<p>The Model T laptops use a system ROM to store the operating system and built-in applications.  In addition
to the built in Operating System ROM (OpSys ROM), the laptops have a socket for adding an additional "Option ROM"
in a covered compartment on the bottom of the unit.  Various option ROMs were developed for the Model T and are
still available today at varous on-line stores / auctions.
<p>VirtualT provides emulation of the Option ROM functinality via menu items on the "Emulation->Option ROM" menu.
The sub-menu title will display the currently loaded Option ROM, if any, and the "Load ROM" and "Unload ROM" items
can be used to control which "ROM" is loaded.  A single ROM can be "loaded" at any given time by choosing the
"Load ROM" menu item and selecting the ROM image file from the browser dialog box.  The ROM image files can be either
binary or Intel-Hex formatted files.  The selected ROM image file will be saved with other Preferences and will
be associated with the current emulation model.   

<h2><a name="memory">Memory Setup</a></h2>
<p>Each Model T was shipped with base memory and an option to install additional memory base on the model.
The Model 100 was upgradeable in 8K increments up to 32K while the Model 200 was upgradeable in 24K increments
up to 72K.  Additional memory expansion products were developed as add-on modules to increase available memory.
Most of these products were designed to connect to the system bus in the expansion compartment on the bottom of
the laptop and provided 128K or 256K of expansion.  The newest expansion module called "ReMem" was developed
by Steven Adolph in the 2006 / 2007 timeframe.  This device boosts the memory capability of the Model T to 
2Meg RAM plus 4Meg FLASH, plus provides legacy interface protocol for the Rampac expansion module.

<p>The default memory emulation in VirutalT matches that of a factory standard unit with maximum RAM expansion.
he selected model.  Additional memory emulation configurations can be selected using the 
"Emulation->Memory Configuration" menu.  This menu item will display the Memory Configuration dialog box 
shown below.
<p><img src="memory_setup.jpg" align="center">

<p>The details of each option are:
<ul>
<li><b>Base Memory </b>- Emulates the maximum "Factory Shipped" memory configuration.
<li><b>Rampac </b> - Emulates Base Memory plus a 256K RAM Rampac expansion module.
<li><b>ReMem </b> - Emulates a ReMem expansion module.  Rampac accesses can be "emulated" by the ReMem
and will show up in the ReMem memory space and RAM file.
<li><b>ReMem + RamPac </b> - Emulates a ReMem expansion module and a Rampac.  Rampac accesses are directed
to the Rampac memory space and saved in the Rampac RAM file.
<p><li>ReMem Overrides Rampac - When both ReMem and Rampac are enabled, they can both respond to Rampac
style I/O operations based on ReMem configuration.  This selection controls which emulation will respond
to the I/O operations and therefore controls which memory space will be updated.  If this option is
checked, then memory updates will be made to ReMem memory, otherwise they will be made to Rampac memory.
<p><li>Make option ROM R/W - Useful for ReMem emulation.  Allows writes to the OptionROM space.
<li>Patch ROM onload (...) - Enables / disables automatic patching to display version on MENU screen.
</ul>

<h2><a name="peripheral">Peripheral Setup</a></h2>
<p>The Peripheral Setup dialog box is accessed via the "Emulation->Peripheral Setup" menu item and allows
configuration of peripheral emulation options.  Currenlty the only peripheral that is supported is the
serial port.  The Peripheral Setup dialog is displayed below.  It has a separate configuration tab for each
of of the peripherals on the Model T, although most of them are simply placeholders for future functionality.


<h3>COM port setup tab</h3>
<p><img src="periph_setup.jpg" align="center">
<p>This tab provides configuration options for emulation of the Model T serial port.  The controls on this tab
provide the follwoing functionality:
<ul>
<li><b>No emulation</b> - No serial port emulation provided.
<li><b>Use Simulated Port</b> - Not supported.  The idea is to provide a scriptable way to emulate something 
connected to a serial port with action / response capabilities.
<li><b>Use Host Port</b> - Provides a list of know host ports to "connect" to the Model T's serial port.
<li><b>Use Other Host Port</b> - Allows the user to type a device name to "connect" to the Model T's serial port.
</ul>
<p>All serial port traffic and configuration updates are trapped by VirtualT and translated into the
appropriate OS system calls to affect the desired response on a "real-world" serial device.  Serial I/O and
configuration data can be monitored in the <a href="tools.html#periph">Peripherial Devices</a> dialog.

<p>

<h3>LPT port setup tab</h3>
<p><img src="lpt_tab.jpg" align="center">
<p>This tab provides configuration options for emulation of the Model T parallel port.  The controls on this tab
provide the follwoing functionality:
<ul>
<li><b>No emulation</b> - No parallel port emulation provided.
<li><b>Connect LPT To</b> - Emulates parallel port hardware and "connects" the printer specified in the listbox below
to the emulated parallel port.  The selected printer can be configured using the "Printer Setup" button.
<p><li>Convert lonely CR to LF - This option, if enabled, converts a single CR to a CRLF sequence.  If a
CR is received as a CRLF pair, no conversion is provided.
<p><li>Auto FormFeed after timeout - This option, if enabled, sends a FormFeed (FF) to the emulated printer
after the spcified number of seconds.
<p><li>Close Session after timeout - This option, if enabled, causes the print session to be automatically
closed after a timeout.  See Print Session below.
</ul>
<p>All parallel port traffic is trapped by VirtualT and directed to the specified printer emulation for
further processing.  For help on the emulated printers, see <a href="printers.html">Emulated Printers</a>.
The LPT emulation maintains a Port Status to track I/O errors, aborted print jobs, and
active Print Sessions.  The valid Port Status values are:

<ul>
<li>Idle - No printer activity or active print session open. Print Sesion closed.
<li>Actv - Data actively being received on the LPT port. Print Session open.
<li>Pend - Previously received data pending transmisison to the printer. Print Session open.
<li>Err  - Indicates an error occurred on the emulated printer.
<li>Abrt - A print job was aborted.  This status will be cleared automatically after a timeout.
</ul>

<p><b> Print Sessions</b>
<p>
As computers have become more advanced, so have the printer system associated with them.  Printing on 
modern computers involves preparing a print job and submitting it for printing, usually to a print
spooler or other print manager.  Since printing on the Model T consists simply of writing bytes to the
LPT port until the job is complete, there is no defined ending for a "print job".  To accomodate printing
to the Host's print spoolers, USB connected and network connected printers, the LPT emulation uses the
concept of Print Sessions.  A Print Session is simply a way of defining a starting and ending point for
a print job.  Data associated with a Print Session will be held until the Print Session is closed, at
which point the entire print operation will be released for print.
<p>Print Sessions are opened automatically when data is first received on the LPT port and will remain
open until either closed automatically through selectable timeout or manually from the Printer Icon
popup menu.  If automatic closure is selected, the timeout specified will be counted from the last
byte received on the LPT port.  Any data received prior to expiration of the timeout time will reset
the timer.

<p><b>Printer Icon</b>
<p>The printer icon on the bottom border of the main window indicates the curent Port Status and data
activity.  Clicking on the Printer Icon will popup a Print Menu for controlling various printer
operations.  During Idle or Pending states, the printer appears normally.  During active data transfer
across the LPT port, the printer animates pages feeding through the printer.  If an error occurs, an
exclamation point appears over the icon and if a print job is canceled, an X appears over the icon.  The
status is also displayed in words to the right of the icon.  The Abort status is needed to allow trapping
and ignoring additional data written to the LPT port after a print is aborted.  Since a Print Session
is not opened for an aborted print job, simply returning to Idle state would prompt the user for print
details upon receipt of the 2nd byte printed, then the 3rd, etc.  The Abort status can also be cleared
by reseting the printer from the printer popup menu.

<p>
<p><b>Print Menu</b>
<p><img src="print_menu.jpg">
<p>The Print menu provides control of the current print session and the currently selected printer.  This
is a popup menu that is accessed by clicking on the Printer Icon in the lower border of the Main Window.
The options in this menu allow the user to cancel print jobs, submit pending print jobs to the destination
output device (files or real printers), reset the printer and choose printer preferences.

<p>

<h3>Clock setup tab</h3>
<p><img src="clock_tab.jpg" align="center">
<p>This tab provides configuration options for emulation of the Model T Real-Time Clock.  Starting with
VirtualT 1.3, the emulated time is no longer fixed to be the same as the host's time.  The controls on 
this tab provide the follwoing functionality:
<ul>
<li><b>Reset to Host Time</b> - Causes the emulated time to match the host's time when VirtualT is
started.  The clock can be changed during the emulation session, but will reset when the program is
restarted.
<li>Reset time when changing models - Resets the emulated clock to the host's time when switching
between emulated models.  VirtualT maintains a single emulated clock source that can be set to any date
(within the limits of the host).  All emulated models use the same virtual clock.  If this clock is changed
in one model, those changes will be reflected in any other model that is selected unless this option is enabled.
<p><li><b>Restore Emulated Time</b> - This option resets the emulation clock to match the 
time of the emulated model when it was last suspended.  Each model can have a unique emulation time that
is saved between emulation sessions.
<li>Time elapses while emulation stopped - This option causes the emulation time to match the last
known time for the specific model, adjusted by the elapsed "real world time" between the last suspension
and the current time.
</ul>
<p>The alarm functions of the real-time-clock are not yet implemented.
