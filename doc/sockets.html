<P> <H1 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="sockets">Chapter 6 - Socket Interface</A></H1>

<P>This chapter describes the socket interface supported by VirtualT.  The Socekt
Interface provides the capability of remote control of most of VirtualT's emulation
functionality.  The interface also adds low-level debug control of the emulation.

<h2><a name="invoking">Invoking</a></h2>
<p>To enable the socket interface, VirtualT must be invoked with a command-line option
to specify the socket port as follows:

<UL><PRE>virtualt -p port_number</PRE></UL>
<p><UL><pre>NOTE:  On Windows platforms, the Windows firewall sometimes blocks unkown ports and may
need to be configured.  Sometimes simply envoking VirtualT with the '-p' option a second time
will "open" the port.</pre></UL>

<P>This will cause VirtualT to launch a socket listener thread for remote control appliations.
To connect to the socket interface using the vt_client application, from a command prompt perform 
the following:
<p><pre>
<OL>
<LI>'cd' to the VirtualT directory
<LI>type './vt_client port_number'
</OL></pre>
<p>The vt_client application will connect to the socket interface of VirtualT and present a
command-line interface for control.  The socket interface can be used by any client to remotely
control VirtualT, such as a Perl script, C++ test bench, or any other socket capable program.  
The vt_client application is just a simple command line example application.

<h2><a name="protocol">Protocol</A></h2>
<p>The socket interface protocol is an ASCII based command / response type protocol.  Commands
must be sent as independant socket messages.  Each command can have one or more arguments formatted
appropriately per command.  Commands are not terminated with a NEWLINE character.  For each command, 
VirtualT will respond with one or more messages depending on the command.  All responses 
will end with the ASCII text "Ok".  Responses that report information will have one or more lines
of data each followed with a NEWLINE (\n) character.   

<p>Here is an example transaction of the socket interface protocol:
<p><pre>
   Client   sends "halt"
   VirtualT sends "Ok"
   Client   sends "pc"
   VirtualT sends "27105\n"
   VirtualT sends "Ok"
   Client   sends "radix 16"
   VirtualT sends "Ok"
   Client   sends "wr pc=0x69e2"
   VirtualT sends "Ok"
   Client   sends "run"
   VirtualT sends "Ok"
</pre>

<h2><a name="events">Async Events</A></h2>
<p>Occasionally VirtualT needs to send a message to the client to indicate an event has occurred.
Reporting of asynchronous events follows a standard format so they can be parsed by the client
application and properly separated from the expected response messages.  The format for async
event reporting is as follows:
<p><pre>
   event, event_name, event_data \n
</pre>
<p>The async events reported by VirtualT 1.0 are:
<p><pre>
   event, break, PC=address     Indicates a breakpoint was encountered
   event, lcdwrite, (r,c),data  Reports data written to the LCD at (r,c) 
</pre>

<h2><a name="debug">Debugger</A></h2>
<p>The socket interface works with the integrated debugger to provide remote debug control
over the VirtualT emulation.  Using this interface, the 8085 CPU can be halted, single
stepped and resumed, breakpoints can be set and / or cleared, and all register and memory
can be read and written.
<p>The debugger allows breakpoints to be set for any memory address in the CPU's 64K
address range.  An unlimited number of breakpoints can be defined.  Each breakpoint can
be defined to cause a break in CPU execution depending on the active ROM and/or RAM bank
of the emulation.  Bank selection that should be monitored by the debugger is established
during the <a href="#set_break">set_break</a> command.  
<p>Breakpoints can also be configured to monitor read and/or write access to specific addresses.
To monitor an address for read or write operations, send a <a href="#set_break">set_break</a> command
specifying the address with "read" and/or "write" parameters.
<p>To perform debug operations, the integrated debugger must interogate the Program Counter (PC)
before excution of every instruction to determine if an active breakpoint has been encountered.
When a breakpoint is encountered, the debugger will halt the CPU execution and send an 
<a href="#events">Async Event</a> to the socket interface.

<h2><a name="lcd">LCD Monitor</A></h2>
<p>The socket interface provides a feature to monitor data sent to the LCD.
This feature was added to help accomodate automated regression testing of VirtualT features
and applications developed using VirtualT as the development platform.  
<p>During LCD monitoring, the integrated debugger is used for monitoring program execution 
to trap function calls made to the "Character Level 6 Plotting" routine.  When a call to 
this routine is detected, VirtualT extracts the plotted character and the curent row and 
column position.  This data is then used to build strings of data representing the data 
written to the LCD.
<p>The LCD monitoring feature can be turned on or off using the <a href="#lcd_mon">
lcd_mon</a> command.  Sometimes during LCD monitoring, it is desireable to ignore portions
of the LCD to eliminate excessive socket messages for data that is written repetitively, 
such as time and date updates on the MENU.  To accomodate this, the user can define up to
10 "ignore regions" using the <a href="#lcd_ignore">lcd_ignore</a> command.  During
LCD monitoring, the socket interface will discard any write operations when the
curent row and column are bounded by one of the ignore regions.


<h2><a name="commands">Commands</A></h2>
<p>VirtualT accepts commands on the socket interface to control emulation options,
access low-level hardware resources, and interface with the VirtualT debugger.  For
commands that accept an address argument, addresses can be represented in decimal format
or in hex format by pre-pending with the standard C "0x" syntax, such as 0xA31.  Addresses
can also be specified by one of the 16 bit registers (pc, sp, bc, de, hl). 
The commands that VirtualT supports are:

parameters:  [address [lineCount]]

returns:     Parameter error
             Disassembled lines of code
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Dissasembles object code using VirtualT's disassembler function.  Includes comments for
the known addresses and variables.  The starting address can be supplied or ommited to 
continue disassembly from the last disassembled address.  If the address is supplied, then 
a line count can also be provided to specify the number of lines to disassemble.<br>
</ul>
<h3><a name="dis_pc">x</a></h3>
<ul>
<p>For disassembling at the current PC location, the shortcut comand "x" (for eXecution) is
provided and is equivalent to "dis pc".  The "x" command can have an optional line_count 
parameter to specifiy the number of lines to disassemble.

</ul>

<ul><pre>
parameters:  Keystroke list

returns:     Parameter error
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Simulates keystroke events on the keyboard.  The keystroke list can be any length
and can consist of quoted string and/or special key symbols as described below.  The key
stroke input will be timed and monitored based on emulation speed to 
validate proper scanning by the keyboard ISR.  To specify the quote character as input in a
quoted string, precede the quote with the '\' character.  To specify the '\' character type '\\'. 
<p><ul><pre>
"  =  \"
\  =  \\
</pre></ul>

Special key symbols are case insensitive.  The special key symbols are:
<ul><p> enter, shift, code, graph, grph, esc, ctrl, tab, f1-f8, paste, label, print, pause,
left, right, up, down, space, insert, ins, delete, del, bksp, back, backspace, home, end,

<h3><a name="lcd_ignore">lcd_ignore (li)</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  ["none", (row,col)-(row,col)] 

returns:     Parameter error
             List of active ignore regions
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Specifies an ignore region on the LCD during LCD monitoring or returns a list
of active ignore regions if no parameter is provided.  If the parameter is "none", 
then all ignore regions are deleted.  If a parameter is specified, it must follow
the format "(row, col)-(row, col)".  All row and col values are "1" based.
Up to 10 ignore regions can be defined.  During
LCD monitoring, any data written to an ignore region will not be reported on the 
socket interface.  This is useful when monitoring repetitive operations, such as
time updates on the MENU, etc.
</ul>

<hr>

<ul><pre>
parameters:  ["on", "off"]

returns:     Parameter error
             Current state of LCD monitoring
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Turns LCD monitoring on, off or reports the current activation state if no 
parameter is provided.  During LCD monitoring, any data written to the LCD that is
not part of an lcd_ignore region will be reported on the socket interface using
an async event.  Data written to the LCD will be reported as strings as long as
it is written to consecutive columns and the time between characters is less than 
.75 seconds.
<p>Turning LCD monitoring on and off does not affect the ignore regions.
</ul>

<hr>

returns:     List of active breakpoints 
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Returns a list of the breakpoints the debugger is actively monitoring, 
one breakpoint per message.  Each breakpoint is reported using the current 
radix in the following format:
<ul><pre>
address: validRegions
</pre></ul>
The validRegions field of the reported breakpoints reports the bank or banks in 
which the breakpoint will be active.  This field will contain one or more of the
following:
<ul><pre>
main mplan opt ram ram2 ram3 read write
</pre></ul>

</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="load">load</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  filename 

returns:     Load Error
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Loads the specified file from the Host OS into the emulated model's "filesystem".
The file is loaded relative to the VirtualT working directory.  If the file cannot
be loaded successfully, a "Load Error" message will be sent to the socket interface.
As with any "Load from Host" operation, this will force a system reset after the 
load is complete.

</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="optrom">optrom</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  ["unload", filename]

returns:     none
             Current option ROM filename
             Invalid hex file
             File not found
             Ok
</pre>
<p>If the comand is sent with no parameters, VirtualT returns the name of the currently
loaded option ROM or "none" if no option ROM is loaded.  If the parameter "unload" is 
sent, VirtualT will unload the option ROM.  If a filename is provided, that file will
be loaded into the Option ROM memory space, or an error will be returned if it cannot
be loaded.
<p>Unlike the menu item "Load / Unload option ROM", this command does not reset the CPU
after loading or unloading a ROM.
</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="out">out</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  address, value

returns:     Parameter error
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Performs a CPU 'out' instruction to the specified port, writing the specified data.  
The out instruction is preformed asynchronously from the emulation.
</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="radix">radix</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  "10", "16"

returns:     Parameter error
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Specifies the radix that should be used when reporting addresses and data to the
socket interface.  The radix parameter does not affect input data.  Input data will
be parsed a standard C regardless of the radix setting. The default radix is 10 (decimal).  
</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="read_mem">read_mem (rm)</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  address [count]

returns:     Data in current radix
             Parameter error
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Reads data from the CPU's 64K memory space and sends it to the socket interface formatted
using the current radix.  If a count value is not specified, VirtualT returns a single byte
of data.  Otherwise it will return 'count' bytes separated by spaces.  The data will be read 
from the CPU's memory space at the time the command is received.  If an OptROM or ReMem 
memory is mapped into the CPU address being requested, then that memory will be read.  
</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="read_reg">read_reg (rr)</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  "all", "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "h", "l", "m"
             "bc", "de", "hl", "pc", "sp"

returns:     Data in current radix
             xx
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Reads one or more CPU register(s) as specified and sends the results to the socket 
interface formatted using the current radix.  The parameters are case insensitive and
must be separated with spaces.  If more than one input parameter is supplied,
then the CPU values will be reported in the same order as the parameters, separated by
spaces.  If the parameter "all" is given, all CPU registers will be read and reported
in the following format:
<ul><pre>
A=## B=## C=## ...
</pre></ul>
<p><a name="regs"></a>As a shortcut, registers can also be read by sending a command with only the 
name of the register and no arguments.  The register value will be returned, formatted
using the current radix value.
<p>This is a debug command and is intended to be used during a CPU halt condition.
If multiple registers are requested while the CPU is running, no provisions are made to 
ensure the registers are sampled during the same CPU cycle.

<p><b>Examples</b>
<ul><pre>
read_reg bc
rr HL m a sp PC
</pre></ul>
  
</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="reset">reset</a></h3>
<ul><pre>

returns:     Ok
</pre>
<p>Performs an emulation system reset.  Does not clear emulation memory.
</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="run">run</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  none

returns:     Ok
</pre>
<p>Resumes the CPU exectuion after a halt command or a breakpoint.  If the CPU is already
running, this operation has no affect.
</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="set_break">set_break (sb)</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  address [validRegions]

returns:     Parameter Error
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Defines a new breakpoint for the integrated debugger.  Breakpoints can be defined for
any address and can be valid for selected banks as determined by the optional validRegions
paramter.  Additionally, breakpoints can be configured to halt CPU excution upon detection of
a read and/or write to a specified address.  Valid values for this parameter are:
<ul><pre>
main opt mplan ram ram2 ram3 read write
</pre></ul>
If no parameter is supplied for validRegions, then VirtualT will default the selection to 
all banks that make sense for the specified address on the emulated model.  There is currently
no provisions for saving breakpoint information between successive VirtualT sessions.

</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="speed">speed</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  "2.4", "friendly", "max"

returns:     Parameter Error
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Sets the emulation speed to the specified value.  Note that only one option is given for
the CPU Friendly speed but the Speed menu item provides two seletions.  The friendly option
in this command will set the speed to match the menu item "CPU Friendly". 

</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="status">status</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  none

returns:     Current model and CPU status
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Returns the current model and CPU running status in the following format:
<ul><pre>

</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="step">step (s)</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  [count]

returns:     Parameter Error
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Causes the CPU to execute one or more instruction beginning at the current Program 
Counter (PC) location.  If no parameter is provided, a single instruction is executed, 
otherwise 'count' instrutions will be executed.

</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="step_over">step_over (so)</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  [count]

returns:     Parameter Error
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Causes the CPU to step over any RST, CALL, CZ, CNZ, etc. instruction and return control
at the next instruction.  The subroutine which is the target of the RST, CALL, etc. will be
executed entirely.  This is accomplished by setting a temporary breakpoint at the instruction
just after the RST, CALL, etc. and allowing the processor to run.  If a breakpoint is 
encountered within the subroutine, running the processor 'run' will cause the program to 
continue to the intended location of the single step.

</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="string">string</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  address

returns:     String data
             Ok
</pre>
<p>Reads data from the CPU's 64K memory space beginning at the address specified and 
formats it as a NULL terminated string.  Data that is not ASCII text will be formatted
using the current radix value and enclosed with '<>' characters. The resulting string 
is written to the socket interface.

</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="terminate">terminate</a></h3>
<ul><pre>
parameters:  none

returns:     Ok
</pre>
<p>Terminates the VirtualT session and forces a clean shutdown (RAM and Preferences
