<P>This chapter describes support for interfacing with the Host OS.  Supported features vary
between Linux, Windows and MacOS and are detailed here.

<P> <H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="dirstruct">Directory Structure</A></H2>
<P>VirtualT uses a very specific directory structure to allow emulation of multiple laptop models
while keeping program data separated (RAM storage files, ROM files, etc.).  Version 1.0 and later
releases will automatically create the necessary directory structure using ROM image files located
in the ROMs subdirectory.  Below is the directory structure that will be created.  The src and
vt_client directories will be present only if the source code was downloaded and unzipped.  

<p>Each of the emulation directories (M10, M100, T200, etc.) will contain machine specific files
such as ROM images and RAM files for base memory and/or ReMem memory.  Additionally they provide
a structure for keeping Model T files (.BA, .CO, etc.) separated when they are targeted for as 
specific model.  While the IDE is not completed yet, it assumes a default project storage directory
under the main VirtualT directory called "Projects".

       |----T200          (Emulation directory)

<P> <H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="ram">RAM Files</A></H2>
<p>VirtualT saves the emulation RAM into a file within active Emulation Directory.  File loading is
done when the program starts and is saved just prior to The file
that is used is dependant on the selected memory configuration (see <a href="emulation.html#memory">Memory Setup</a>.
For Base Memory configurations, the RAM is saved in a file named RAM.bin.  The file is a binary 
copy of the emulation RAM.  On models that contain multiple RAM banks such as the T200, each RAM
bank is stored to the file in sequence followed by a single byte representing the active RAM bank.
<p>
For ReMem meory configuration, the RAM and FLASH contents are saved in a file named remem.bin.  This
file contains three 2M binary sections.  The first section is the 2M RAM chip contents, the second
section is the FLASH1 chip contents, and the third section is the FLASH2 chip contents. 

<P> <H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="files">Loading / Saving Files</A></H2>
<p>Model T files (.BA, .DO, etc.) can be loaded from and saved to the Host Operating System using
the "Load from Host" and "Save to Host" menu items in the File menu.  When performing load and save
operations, VirtualT manually reads and writes to system RAM during emulation.  The reads / writes
include accessing the File Directory Table, the file storage areas, and system pointers and variables
used for memory management and housekeeping.  For this reason, files should be loaded and saved only 
when there is no file activity in the emulation.  After a Load from Host operation, Virtualt performs
a warm reset of the emulation to force a redraw of the Menu screen.  This warm reset will occur
regardless of the current emualtion state (running BASIC, TEXT, etc.).
<p>
During load operations, VirtualT will automatically determine if the file being loaded is too
large for available memory, determine the type of file being loaded base on file extension,
tokenize ASCII BASIC files, and determine the appropriate location in memory to store the file.
Currently any file extension other than .BA, .DO or .CO are converted into .DO files and loaded
as TEXT documents.  This functionality needs to be changed in future releases to detect 2 character
extensions and load them with no conversion.

<P> <H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="preferences">Preferences</A></H2>
Preferences for VirtualT settings, such as CPU emulation speed, Display size, etc., are saved to 
the host when VirtualT is terminated and restored when it is launched again.  The preferences are
saved by the FLKT library routines and the storage method are OS dependant.  The following are the 
locations of the VirtualT preferences files for each OS:

<p><pre>
     Linux   -  $HOME/.fltk/virtualt./virtualt.prefs
     MacOS   -  $HOME/Library/Preferences/virtualt./virtualt.prefs
     Windows -  C:/Documents and Settings/UserName/Application Data/virtualt/virtualt.prefs
</pre>

<p>VirtualT saves general settings such as display characteristics on a global basis and emulation 
preferences such as memory configuration and ROM / RAM filenames on a per model basis.
